# COVID-19, Explorative Data Analysis and Visualisation

Currently a simple Jupyter Notebook for explorative data analysis based on a COVID dataset provided by the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).

Cumulative sum and growth factor for confirmed cases and deaths are computed.

Log scale visualisation are produced.

The notebook is updated daily with the latest available dataset.

The use of this notebook requires knowledge in python and pandas.
