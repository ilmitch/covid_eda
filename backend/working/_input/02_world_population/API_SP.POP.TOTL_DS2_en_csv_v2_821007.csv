Inspired by your video, I have created a repository on GitHub (https://github.com/ilmitch/covid_eda) with a Jupyter Notebook providing some basic explorative data analysis and visualisations based on the "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control" COVID dataset. I also computed the growth factor explained in your video. I was surprised by his noisy behaviour, in particular if compared to the theoretical case. I fear it may not be a reliable indicator to detect the end of the pandemic.
